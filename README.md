# Development of Low–Cost Air Quality Stations for Next Generation Monitoring Networks: Calibration and Validation of NO2 and O3 Sensors

Authors: Cavaliere et all. (2023)

## Abstract
This paper assessed calibration models for two LC stations equipped with O3 and NO2 MOS sensors. Environmental parameters were found to improve accuracy in both linear and black box models. Moreover interpretability methods as SHapley Additive exPlanations helped identify physical patterns and potential problems of these models in field validation. Results showed both sensors performed well with the same linear model form, but unique coefficients were required for inter–sensor variability.
